## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- Fixed bus info panel not opening.
  - Debugged and ensured the BusInfoPanel is rendered and triggered correctly in `MapScreen` and `useBusNavigation`.
- Redesigned bus info panel UI to match the provided screenshot.
  - Updated the panel to include arrival time at the top, share button, progress slider, travel time, and a vertical timeline with stops, times, and current/next stop highlighting.
- Implemented clustering for bus markers to improve map clarity.
  - Used `react-native-map-clustering` to group nearby bus markers.
- Made bus markers responsive to zoom levels.
  - Adjusted marker sizes dynamically based on the map's zoom level.
- Added logic to handle bus journeys:
  - Removed buses from the map when they reach their destination.
  - Restarted bus journeys from the destination to the start point after a delay, reversing stops and updating the ETA.

## üöß Remaining Work

- Optimize performance for large numbers of buses on the map.
- Add unit tests for critical components like `BusMarker` and `MapScreen`.
- Improve error handling for edge cases (e.g., missing location permissions, network issues).
- Enhance the UI for clustering to show the number of buses in a cluster.
- Finalize documentation for clustering and responsive markers in `docs/`.
